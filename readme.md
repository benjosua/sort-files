# File Sorting Program

This program is designed to take all files in the current directory and sort them into folders based on their file extension.

## Usage
Compile and run the program. All files in the current directory will be sorted into folders with the same name as their file extension.

## Example
If the current directory contains two files `input.txt` and `output.c`, the program will create two folders named `txt` and `c` in the same directory. The files will then be moved into the respective folder. 

## Output
The program should output `Program ends successfully` when all files have been sorted successfully.
